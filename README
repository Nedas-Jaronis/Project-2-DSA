### Spotify Song Recommendation Algorithm
A sophisticated song recommendation system that uses BFS and DFS algorithms to find personalized song suggestions from a dataset of 600,000+ Spotify tracks.

## Overview
This program analyzes your music preferences by calculating statistical data from your inputted playlist and uses tree traversal algorithms to recommend similar songs. The application features:
* Interactive UI with dynamic search and playlist management
* Real-time visualization of song statistics via a polar chart
* Dual algorithm suppport (BFS and DFS) for recommendation generation
* Large-scale dataset of 600,000 Spotify songs ranging from 1921 - 2020
* Personalized recommendations based on standard deviation derived calculations

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites
* Node.js
* Python
* npm (comes with Node.js)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. extract the spotify dataset
> python dataExtraction.py
3. Install dependencies
> npm install express
4. Start the backend
> cd .\backend\
> node server.js
5. Start the frontend
> npm run dev
6. Open the application by navigating to the localhost URL displayed in your terminal

2. View Statistics: Watch as the polar chart updates in real-time as you add songs to your playlist, displaying the average statistics.
3. Get Recommendations: Click either the **BFS** or **DFS** button to generate your recommendations.
4. Explore Results: View your 10 personalized song recommendations in the right-hand side panel. If you would like to add a recommendation to your playlist, simply click on the recommendation and it will be automatically added.

**Troubleshooting
If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download
If you forgot to install dependencies, you can go back and check and run
> npm install express
If your dataExtraction.py fails, you can download the dataset directly from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks?select=tracks.csv
If you do this, make sure to place the tracks.csv file in your \backend\data\ directory
An executable is included, but if you need or want to recompile for any reason, you can run:
> g++ tree.cpp -o tree
